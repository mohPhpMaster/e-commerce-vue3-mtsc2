Deploying a Nuxt.js application on an Apache server involves several steps, including building the project for
production, configuring Apache, and setting up the server environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Build the Nuxt.js Application**

First, you need to build your Nuxt.js application for production.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `.output` directory (or `.nuxt/dist` in older versions) containing the built files.

### 2. **Install Necessary Dependencies on the Server**

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your server. You can check this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, you can install them using your package manager:

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs npm
  ```

- **On CentOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install nodejs npm
  ```

### 3. **Transfer Files to the Server**

Upload your project files to the server using FTP/SFTP, or any other file transfer method. Typically, you would place
the files in a directory under `/var/www/html` or any other directory configured for your virtual host.

### 4. **Configure Apache**

You need to configure Apache to serve your Nuxt.js application.

#### a. **Create a Virtual Host File**

Create a new Apache virtual host configuration file, e.g., `yourdomain.conf`, in the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`
directory (Ubuntu/Debian) or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` (CentOS).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/yourproject

    <Directory /var/www/html/yourproject>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ProxyRequests off
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### 5. **Enable Required Apache Modules**

Enable the `proxy` and `proxy_http` modules, which are required for reverse proxying.

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
```

Also, enable the new virtual host and rewrite module:

```bash
sudo a2ensite yourdomain.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

Finally, restart Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 6. **Start Your Nuxt.js Application**

You need to run your Nuxt.js application in `production` mode. SSH into your server, navigate to your project directory,
and start the application using PM2 or directly with Node.js:

- **With PM2** (recommended for production):

  ```bash
  npm install pm2 -g
  pm2 start npm --name "nuxt-app" -- run start
  ```

- **Without PM2**:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

This will start your Nuxt.js application on port `3000` by default.

### 7. **Test the Deployment**

After setting up Apache and starting your Nuxt.js application, visit `http://yourdomain.com` in your browser to check if
everything is working correctly.

### 8. **Set Up SSL (Optional but Recommended)**

For production environments, itâ€™s highly recommended to secure your site with SSL.

You can use Let's Encrypt to set up SSL for free:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache
```

Follow the prompts to configure SSL for your domain.

### 9. **Monitor and Manage the Application**

Use PM2 or a similar tool to monitor and manage your application in production. PM2 can automatically restart your
application if it crashes and can also be set up to run on system boot.

```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Summary

- **Build** the application for production using `npm run build`.
- **Transfer** the files to the server.
- **Configure** Apache with a virtual host and reverse proxy.
- **Start** the application using Node.js or PM2.
- **Test** to ensure it's running, and optionally set up **SSL** for security.

This will get your Nuxt.js application up and running on an Apache server.
